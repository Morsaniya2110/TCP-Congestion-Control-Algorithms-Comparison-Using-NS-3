# TCP-Congestion-Control-Algorithms-Comparison-Using-NS-3
This project analyzes and compares the performance of four major TCP congestion control algorithms using NS-3.41:  TCP NewReno ,TCP Vegas,  TCP Cubic  and TCP BBR . The goal is to measure throughput, end-to-end delay, and fairness under the same network scenario and visualize the results using Python.
